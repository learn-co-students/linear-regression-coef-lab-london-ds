# Regression Coef Lab

This repo can be used to help clarify misconceptions that students have on details of running a linear regression model.
Right now the repo has information on multicollinearity, standardising predictors, and comparing sets of beta coefs.
Future versions of this should include the entire process and why people choose each step.
